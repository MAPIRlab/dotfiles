## Installation

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andresgongora/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x ./bootstrap
./bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles/home` to your home directory.



## Thanks

I forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)' excellent
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) before, the same as he did,
writing my own. Specially the file-linking part of the script is inspired by his code.
